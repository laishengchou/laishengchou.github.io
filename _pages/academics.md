## TEACHING INNOVATIONS

### Program: Global Externship Programs

Role in program:	Founder and Director (2010 – )

Dr. Chou developed the SDM PH650 Global Externship program for fourth-year dental students at Boston University, allowing them to complete part of their curriculum abroad. This program underscores BU Dental School's commitment to being a global institute in the 21st century. From 2010 to 2021, Dr. Chou, as an advisor to the Dean, leveraged his connections with dental schools worldwide to establish externship programs with seven schools in Japan, China, Thailand, South Korea, and India. These volunteer-based externships offer selected fourth-year DMD students a 2-week rotation in alternative clinical settings abroad, enhancing their clinical skills, critical thinking, and cultural competencies.

### Course:	BUSDM - “Oral Medicine”

Role in course: 	Course Director (2000 – )

In fall 2000, Dr. Chou developed a didactic course for undergraduate students to address the lack of formal training in this discipline within the school's curriculum. Competency in serving patients and preparing for the Oral Medicine-oriented National Dental Board Exam had become critical issues. To meet this need, the course covers rational procedures for diagnosing oral lesions, medical risk assessment, managing medically compromised dental patients, and understanding oral manifestations of systemic diseases. Dr. Chou has served as the course director and key lecturer since its inception, and it is now one of the school's top-ranked courses.

### Program:	BUSDM “Program for DMD-III Oral Medicine Clinical Rotation”

Role in program: 	Course Director (1995 – )

Dr. Chou created this clinical training program in 1995, sponsored by the PHS National Education and Training Center. Third-year students participate in an Oral Medicine rotation, observing the diagnosis and treatment of oral mucosal lesions, craniofacial neural diseases, TMJ disorders, and medically compromised dental patients. Faculty provide comprehensive reviews of histology, biology, pathology, pharmacology, and radiology for each patient. A microscope is available in the clinic for histological review of biopsies. This unique program has significantly enhanced the clinical competency of dental students.
	
### Course:	SDM PR830 - “Advanced Biomaterials”

Role in course: 	Course Director (1994 – )

Dr. Chou developed this course in 1994 to address the growing number of graduate students and the need for formal training in advanced biomaterials. Designed for Master's and Doctor of Science candidates, this two-semester course includes lectures and seminars on dental biomaterials, covering research methodology, chemical, physical, and biological properties, and clinical applications of ceramics, metals, polymers, composites, and other materials. Students engage in literature reviews and research proposals, and present their research projects to track their progress. For the past 28 years, the course has been well-received and effective. Dr. Chou has served as the Course Director, overseeing curriculum and administration.
